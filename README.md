### A simple Rock paper scissors game, with a kawaii theme. Uses Firebase to update global variables. Once two players have selected a character, the game starts. Anyone else on the page will be able to spectate and chat.  

### While a round is in progress, players can press any of the rock, paper, or scissors icons to make a selection. If no selection is made when time runs out, a selection is chosen at random for the player. Once the results are displayed, both players have the option to begin a new round. If a player leaves at any time, anyone viewing the page will receive an alert and be returned to the player select screen. A player who stays through this and plays a new game will keep their score and chat history. 

## I hope you enjoy!
